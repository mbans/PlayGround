/**
 * Purpose:
 * 	Provde an interface that delegates the CREATION calls to one or more concreate classes in order to deliver 
 *  specific objects

 *  ii.  Systems should be able to use families of similar objects
 *  iii. Libraries required without exposing creation logic
 *  iv.  Concrete classes hidden from clients
 * 
 * Application:
 * 	i.	Creation of factories for producing different trade types? 
 * 	
 * 
 * Where I have used:
